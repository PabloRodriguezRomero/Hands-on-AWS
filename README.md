# Hands-on-AWS

Recently I get the AWS SAA certification on my way to achieve a cloud position role for the next year. During my preparation in AWS exams I learned about some
elements that I want to get in touch with:

  -Least privilege policy attached to admin
  -VPC setup and Subnetting
  -Internet Gateway
  -Route tables and ACL's
  
In this way, I created an architecture which recieves user requests over ACL's port 80/443 in public subnet and then the private subnet over MySQL and
MicrosoftSQL ports (1433 and 3306).

Next step will be the automation of these and more services with Cloudformation!
